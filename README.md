# MovieLibrary
This a web page that displays some of my favorite movies where a user can view their trailers. The Movie Database API is used.

How to run:
- Put both the files in the same directory.
- Run movie.py using Python 2.7.
- An HTML file will be generated in the directory, and it should open automically in a broswer when the program finishes running.

References:
 - I wrote the movie.py following the tutorials on the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer course.
 - The fresh_tomatoes is a file I acquired my the Udacity course mentioned above.
